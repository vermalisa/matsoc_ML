- Learned a diverse set of topics such as:- 1) Regression - Linear, Logistic, Multi feature and Polynomial ; 2) Model
  Selection; 3) Decision Tress; 4) Bagging and Boosting; 5) Introduction to Neural Networks.
â€“ Performed data cleaning, visualized data relationships using scatter plots and hence trained a polynomial
  regression model, learned to identify the optimal degree based on MSE (Mean Squared Error), rained a neural
  network using TensorFlow, trained a decision tree using scikit-learn, made ensemble predictions by averaging the outputs
  of the decision tree and another model, and finally evaluated the performance of each model using error metrics.
